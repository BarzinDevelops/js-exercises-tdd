The GOAL of this assignment is to test the function in './greet-people.js'.
The expected outcome is to have a list of names (which are in de array: mentors) preceeded with 'Hello'. So this would be the result when you run
the function=> greetPeople(people):

Hello Irina
Hello Ashleigh
Hello Etza

*Optional:
    You can try to make an array on your own with other names to see
    if the outcome is still a list of Hello [your array item].

Good luck and have fun ;-)
