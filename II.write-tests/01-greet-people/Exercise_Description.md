The GOAL of this assignment is to test the function in './greet-people.js'.
The expected outcome is to have a list of names (which are in de array: mentors) preceeded with 'Hello'. So this would be the result when you run
the function=> greetPeople(mentors):

['Hello Irina', 'Hello Ashleigh', 'Hello Etza']

The mentors array is already in the greet-people.test.js file. You do have to think
about where to use it.

*Optional:
    You can alos try to make your own array with other names to see
    if the outcome is still a list of 'Hello [your array item]'.

Good luck and have fun ;-)
